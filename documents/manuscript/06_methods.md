
## Methods

A summary of all occurrences by metabarcoding from sweep net samples obtained by Bowser et al. [-@Bowser_et_al_2020] were downloaded from Arctos on 12 November 2020 (saved search URI: <https://arctos.database.museum/saved/2020-11-12-1157_Slikok_metabarcoding_taxa_list>), yielding a list of 975 unique identifications. For unidentified molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUS) where 10 or more occurrences were observed, we attempted to improve identifications by submitting the corresponding sequences to BOLD's Identification Engince and NCBI BLASTn. We obtained no new identifications.

The 2,375 occurrences were downloaded on 12 November 2020 (saved search URI: <https://arctos.database.museum/saved/2020-11-12-1400_Slikok_project_metabarcoding_occurrences>).
