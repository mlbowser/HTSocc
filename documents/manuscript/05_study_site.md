The study site was described by Bowser et al. [-@Bowser_et_al_2020]. The study site was a portion of the Slikok Creek watershed on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR). The resulting 938 ha study area occupied a bounding box from 60.44° to 60.47° latitude and from -151.10° to -151.03° longitude.

Based on data from the National Land Cover Database [@Homer_et_al_2015], the land area of this study area was coverd mostly by mixed forest (29%), evergreen forest (22%), emergent herbaceous wetlands (13%), deciduous forest (12%), woody wetlands (11%), and open water (10%). Common trees in well-drained areas were white spruce (*Picea glauca* (Moench) Voss), Alaska birch (*Betula pendula* subsp. *mandshurica* (Regel) Ashburner & McAll.), quaking aspen (*Populus tremuloides* Michx.), and cottonwood (*Populus* × *hastata* Dode). Black spruce (*Picea mariana* Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.) was the dominant tree in forested wetlands. Herbaceous wetlands were characterized by mosses, sedges, and low shrubs. Shallow, eutrophic lakes (Headquarters Lake, Nordic Lake, and smaller, unnamed lakes) accounted for most of the open water in the study area.
