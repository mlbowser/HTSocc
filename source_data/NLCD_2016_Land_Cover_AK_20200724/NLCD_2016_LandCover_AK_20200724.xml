      <abstract>This update to the Alaska National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2016 replaces the files dated 20200213.  In this update the landcover footprint was extended along the northern coast to include the islands that were missed in previous versions, and several duplicate roads (offset by 1 or 2 pixels) were removed on the Aleutian Islands. The Alaska National Land Cover Database 2016 was created using change detection between the nominal dates of 2011 and 2016 utilizing Google Earth engine composites of Landsat imagery. Traditionally, previous classifications of Alaska used path row data and spectral comparisons between path rows along with ancillary data to derive areas of change. Alaska has many challenges for land cover classification, with the largest of these being a very short “leaf on” imagery season for acceptable phenology. This is compounded by persistent cloud cover during this growing season, and increasing terrain shadow and sun angle problems outside of this season.  For this reason, the timeframe of 10 years was needed for the first update to the Alaska land cover in order to have enough acceptable imagery between these 2001 and 2011 nominal dates that met these criteria in order to provide reasonable change detection. For 2016, there was not enough complete path row imagery to do this similar change detection. Google Earth engine was employed to create a composite imagery mosaic that uses much smaller pieces of Landsat imagery to create a complete Landsat imagery snapshot used to create change detection between 2011 and 2016. Although this composite technique is not as scientifically rigorous as utilizing direct Landsat imagery, it was the only method available to us during production that would allow completion of change detection in the desired five year timeframe.

The original published 2001 and 2011 Alaska NLCD classifications are generally unchanged, except for slight updates in the northern part of the state to remove perennial ice and snow that were a result of lack of suitable imagery in the 2001 timeframe representing minimum snow and ice extent. See the 2001 and 2011 Land Cover products for the specific metadata process steps associated with the creation of those datasets.</abstract>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Alaska NLCD 2016 was generated using Google Earth engine composite imagery mosaics. A single 2011 Google Earth engine image utilized USGS Landsat five top of atmosphere data from 2008 through 2011. Two composites for 2016 were generated using USGS Landsat eight tier 1 top of atmosphere data from 2015 to 2017, and another from 2014 to 2017. Two composites for the 2016 nominal date were used to allow a wider time window needed to address persistent cloud and shadow problems along with terrain shadow problems throughout Alaska. All three of these dates utilized median value based compositing.

These three composites also utilized temporal filtering to restrict the dates and months used in the composite. These composites also utilized cloud masking from the Landsat collection one level I quality assessment band to capture clouds and shadows. The median value was computed for each band per pixel and the imagery was clipped to the NLCD Alaska boundary extent. These images were exported as a tagged image file to Google Drive. The data were downloaded and reprojected to create the final imagery mosaics in the NLCD Alaska Albers projection.

To further improve the ability to create valid change detection, the two 2016 images were used to create a single composite image. A model was created to identify potential cloud and shadow areas in the 2015 to 2017 composite image. These cloud and shadow areas were replaced with pixels from the 2014 to 2017 composite image which utilized a longer timeframe to minimize cloud and shadow areas. Problem areas still persisted in southern perennial ice and snow mountain areas. These were manually filled to create a seamless composite. Once these two comparable composite images were created, the change detection process was similar to the 2011 process referenced here.

Jin, Suming, Yang, Limin, Zhu, Zhe, Homer, Collin G., A land cover change detection and classification protocol for updating Alaska NLCD 2001 to 2011: Remote Sensing of Environment, v. 195, p. 44–55, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.04.021

These were combined into a vegetation disturbance layer to create a disturbance map from approximately 1940 until current. 

Tasseled cap, normalized burn ratio (NBR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) images were calculated.  Ancillary data included:

 - Digital elevation model (DEM) and derivatives (slope and aspect), 

- Fire and forest thinning polygons obtained from the state of Alaska, Landfire, and the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) Fire disturbance areas were directly downloaded from the MTBS website. . https://mtbs.gov/direct-download, I directly download U.S. 1984-2016 Burned Areas Boundaries Dataset (mtbs_perims_DD.shp).  These were utilized to create a fire year image for the entire Alaska timeframe that was available.  Forest harvest disturbance was download from the Forest Service website. https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?xmlKeyword=harvest _USA.Activity_TimberHarvest.shp.  These were combined to make a vegetation disturbance layer from 1940 to the current date.

- Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow/ice raster data, and - 2001 NLCD. 

Change detection and classification models used NLCD and ancillary data to predict land cover classes for changed areas. The general modeling process was as follows: 1. Biomass increase was calculated from spectral and DEM derivatives, plus 2001 land cover. 2. Biomass increase was added to the disturbance data, yielding a disturbance template. 3. The disturbance template plus the spectral derivatives (NBR, NDVI) were compared to the 2001 land cover to model updated vegetation change areas. 4. The updated vegetation change areas were inserted into the 2011 land cover to create training data for a classification and regression tree (CART) model. 5. A CART classification was used to detect unmapped disturbances and change. 6. The vegetation classification was refined to detect and correct for areas of shadow and succession after forest fires, clearing or thinning. 7. Snow/ice change was detected using an algorithm based on NDWI plus topography (correction for shadows) and MODIS snow/ice data, which yielded snow/ice change areas. 8. Water change was detected using a Landsat-based water change detection algorithm, refined by land cover and topography data (shadow areas) to detect changes. 9. The vegetation, snow/ice, and water change areas were combined to update the overall classification and to derive a set of change pixels. 10. Change pixels in urban/developed areas were created by modeling change in major cities. Manual editing was used to add developed change for small towns and other features. After all mapping units were processed, the change pixels were mosaicked and checked for consistency and quality. Manual edits were used to clean up areas that were incorrectly classified. Snow, ice, and water extents were mapped directly from Landsat imagery. As a result, the extent of snow, ice, and water reflects the year and season when the imagery was recorded. Differences in snow, ice, and water extent between 2001 and 2011 may not reflect perennial changes in their extent, but simply reflect seasonal change between the two time periods.</procdesc>
