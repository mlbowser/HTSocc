DOCUMENTING DISTRIBUTIONS OF HYPERDIVERSE GROUPS (TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES) THROUGH GRID-BASED SPATIAL SAMPLING, HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING, AND OCCUPANCY MODELING


Summary

This is a repository for a draft manuscript on occupancy modeling using
terrestrial invertebrate data from Bowser et al.Â (2020). It is currently
being formatted for submission to the Journal of the Entomological
Society of British Columbia.

The directory structure conforms to the recommended file structure of
the Alaska Region Data Stewardship Team (2019).
